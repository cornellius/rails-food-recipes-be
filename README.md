## Goal

> **It's dinner time! Create a Rails + React.js application that helps users find the most relevant recipes that they can prepare with the ingredients that they have at home**

## The prototype

Prototype in this case means:

- something usable, yet as simple as possible
- with Rails, SQL database, React.js on the front-end
- UI / design is not important
- Not adding features which are outside the basic scope of the problem
- Mainly focus on code quality & user experience, not UX/UI polishment
